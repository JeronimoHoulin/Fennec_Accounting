# Fennec_Accounting
This repo is holding all logic that runs once the futures contract reach maturity, and user's positions have to be closed to gather interest.
Because markets can close a little lower and / or higher than expected, these accounting scripts make sure that users have their correct capital + interests available. 
As well as repaying the withdrawl requests back to the user's Web3 wallet.
